### Services & Dependency Injection

![Screenshot 2024-03-31 at 9 42 39 PM](https://github.com/gauripatil/angular-complete-guide/assets/3206551/747a1b3a-f328-41c5-b268-e942e2ba1802)


In Angular, a service is a TypeScript class that encapsulates functionality that can be shared across multiple parts of an application. Services are commonly used to perform tasks such as data fetching, business logic processing, authentication, logging, and more. They promote code reusability, modularity, and maintainability by centralizing common functionality that multiple components or modules may require.

Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern used by Angular to manage the dependencies of a component or service. With DI, Angular's injector system automatically provides the necessary dependencies to a component or service when it is created, rather than requiring the component or service to create its dependencies directly. This makes components and services more modular and easier to test, as dependencies can be easily swapped out or mocked.

In simpler terms:

- **Service:** A service is a TypeScript class that provides a specific functionality or service to other parts of an Angular application.

- **Dependency Injection:** Dependency injection is a mechanism in Angular that automatically provides the necessary dependencies (services or other objects) to a component or service when it is created. This allows components and services to be decoupled from their dependencies, making them more modular, reusable, and testable.

In summary, services and dependency injection are fundamental concepts in Angular that promote code organization, reusability, and maintainability by allowing common functionality to be encapsulated in services and injected into components as needed.


In Angular, services are classes that are responsible for providing functionality that can be shared across components, directives, and other services within an application. They are commonly used for tasks such as data fetching, state management, authentication, logging, and more. Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern used by Angular to provide services to components and other parts of the application.

Here's how service and dependency injection work in Angular:

### 1. Creating a Service:
You can create a service using the Angular CLI or manually by creating a TypeScript class with the `@Injectable()` decorator from `@angular/core`.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class DataService {
  getData() {
    return ['item1', 'item2', 'item3'];
  }
}
```

### 2. Registering a Service:
Angular provides various ways to register a service, such as providing it at the root level, in a specific module, or even at the component level.

- **Root level:** By providing the service in the `@Injectable()` decorator with `providedIn: 'root'`, Angular automatically registers the service at the root injector.

- **Module level:** You can provide the service in a specific module by adding it to the `providers` array of the module's metadata.

### 3. Injecting a Service:
You can inject a service into a component, directive, or another service by including it as a constructor parameter.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from './data.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let item of items">{{ item }}</li>
    </ul>
  `
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  items: string[];

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {
    this.items = this.dataService.getData();
  }
}
```

### 4. Dependency Injection:
Angular's dependency injection system automatically resolves and injects the required dependencies (services) into the constructor of a component or other injectable class. It provides a centralized way to manage and inject dependencies throughout the application, making it easier to maintain and test.

### 5. Singleton Services:
By default, services registered with `providedIn: 'root'` are singleton instances. Angular maintains a single instance of the service throughout the application and shares it wherever it's injected.

### 6. Hierarchical Injection:
Angular's DI system follows a hierarchical injection pattern, where services can be injected at different levels (root, module, component) and are inherited by child components.

### 7. Testing Services:
Angular's dependency injection makes it easy to write unit tests for services by providing mock implementations or using dependency injection tokens to replace real dependencies with test doubles.

Overall, services and dependency injection are core concepts in Angular that enable efficient sharing of functionality and data across different parts of an application while promoting modularity, testability, and maintainability.
