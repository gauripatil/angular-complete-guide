In Angular, a service is a TypeScript class that encapsulates functionality that can be shared across multiple parts of an application. Services are commonly used to perform tasks such as data fetching, business logic processing, authentication, logging, and more. They promote code reusability, modularity, and maintainability by centralizing common functionality that multiple components or modules may require.

Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern used by Angular to manage the dependencies of a component or service. With DI, Angular's injector system automatically provides the necessary dependencies to a component or service when it is created, rather than requiring the component or service to create its dependencies directly. This makes components and services more modular and easier to test, as dependencies can be easily swapped out or mocked.

In simpler terms:

- **Service:** A service is a TypeScript class that provides a specific functionality or service to other parts of an Angular application.

- **Dependency Injection:** Dependency injection is a mechanism in Angular that automatically provides the necessary dependencies (services or other objects) to a component or service when it is created. This allows components and services to be decoupled from their dependencies, making them more modular, reusable, and testable.

In summary, services and dependency injection are fundamental concepts in Angular that promote code organization, reusability, and maintainability by allowing common functionality to be encapsulated in services and injected into components as needed.
